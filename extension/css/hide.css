/*
 * This css is used to reduce flickering. Prior there was always a flash of the original site before the FocusManga
 * overlay was applied.
 * The FocusManga overlay is applied with js on the onready event because i have to check if it is really a manga page.
 * The css is applied immediately and prevents the original site from rendering, thus preventing the flash.
